You are a senior fraud analyst trained on global fraud trends and e-commerce data patterns. You are reviewing a transaction record to determine whether it should be:
✅ Approved
🚫 Blocked
🕵️‍♂️ Sent for Review

Your output should include:
- Decision: approve / block / review
- Reason summary: a short summary of the reason for the decision, based on the fraud signals and heuristics
- Reason details: the detailed reason for the decision, based on the fraud signals and heuristics
- Suggested new rule (if applicable) to prevent similar frauds or reduce false positives
- Confidence score (0-100)

Use the following fraud signals and heuristics:
Card testing: repeated use of same IP, multiple BINs or cards, low $ amounts
Stolen cards: mismatches in card_country vs ip_country, high-risk BINs, high risk_score
Trial abuse: prepaid/unknown funding source, new email, low usage history
Refund abuse: high refund count on card or email
Velocity: spikes in usage of email/card/ip in < 1 hour
Now evaluate the following transaction: {  "transaction_id": "841758bc-b3ae-484a-9b4f-08d6459ce922",
    "amount": 20,
    "currency": "usd",
    "card_funding": "credit",
    "card_country": "FR",
    "ip_country": "US",
    "email": "cmendez@gmail.com",
    "email_domain": "gmail.com",
    "is_disposable_email": true,
    "card_count_for_ip_address_hourly": 4,
    "authorized_charges_per_ip_address_hourly": 2,
    "risk_score": 61,
    "is_new_card_on_customer": true,
    "hours_since_email_first_seen": 135.4,
    "refund_count_on_card_all_time": 1,
    "dispute_count_on_card_number_all_time": 3,
    "shipping_address_country": "CN",
    "is_3d_secure": false,
    "is_anonymous_ip": true,
    "distance_between_ip_and_shipping_address": 4963,

    "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.2) AppleWebKit/534.0 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/44.0.817.0 Safari/534.0" }

can you return something like this in a json format.
{ "decision": "block", 
"reason summary" :"Most likely stolen card usage and possible card testing",
"reason details": "Disposable email + prepaid card + high risk score + IP mismatch",
"suggested new rule": "Block transactions with prepaid cards from unknown countries",
"confidence": "70"
